*An Impropmtu Network*

I would like to build a social network website that targets
the Korean or non-Korean population currently attending
college in the U.S.
I have always wanted a platform that allows me to reach out
to those that I have never had the chance to encounter.
For instance, although our school is renowned for 
having a dense Korean population, small groups tend to form
and that is it; once the clique is settled, we do not see
much moving populations thereon.
I believe creating a community like this will nurture new
exciting opportunities and give students a more profound
experience during college.
Not only that, this site can help those in dilemmatic
situations like: having an odd number of party going to Six 
Flags and in urgent need of one more person to tag along, or
wanting to go to the movies but all my 
friends are busy that night, etc.

The page will consist of the following features:

1. A search tab (that allows the user to choose which school
he or she may attend)
2. A list of several categories (Grocery shopping,
general hangout, travel, car pool, etc.)
3. A place where users can post and leave comments
4. Since this is an impromptu network, users are not
permitted to post or view what has been posted from
midnight to 7 a.m.
At 7 a.m., the site reopens.
